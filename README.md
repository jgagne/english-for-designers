# English for Designers

Work-in-progress coursework:

1. [Content First](content-first)
   - Drop cap and type specimen artifacts and assets. Alt texts and meta content. And a bit of storytelling, accessible for everyone — even Mom.
2. [First Impressions](first-impressions)
   - Handshakes and taglines, all about me, and a preview of my best work.
